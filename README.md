Modified the DIG4539C lab 4 in the following ways:

-Converted all components into functional components (I like them more)
-Implemented a cart component which will take stock of items added to cart. User is able to add and remove items from cart
-Implemented a header with a title that shows a running tally of the amount of items in the cart. (Also contains a link to the cart and to "my account" which are not implemented yet)
